# TensorFlow_Exercises
The codes I made while I practiced various TensorFlow examples

### About the codes
I didn't create these codes by myself, but re-create the codes while I was practicing other TensorFlow examples. Here is the list of example codes I refered to.

- Sungjun Choi, [Tensorflow-101](https://github.com/sjchoi86/Tensorflow-101)
- Aymeric Damien, [Tensorflow-Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/)
- Nathan Lints, [Tensorflow-Tutorials](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials)
- Parag K. Mital, [Tensorflow-Tutorials](https://github.com/pkmital/tensorflow_tutorials)

### List of the exercise codes

1. [Linear Regression]() 
2. [Logistic Regression]()
3. [Multilayer Perceptron]()
4. [Modern Multilayer Perceptron]()
